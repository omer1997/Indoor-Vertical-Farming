# Indoor-Vertical-Farming
For this Project, our proposal and area of concen- tration will focus on microgreen vertical farming and the effects of plant growth under different lighting conditions. Todayâ€™s top industries are constantly seeking lighting conditions that will optimize plant growth in indoor environments to maximize profits and to control photosynthetic active radiation and intensity provided to plant organisms. Through our project, we will explore the benefits of growing microgreens under light emitting diodes (LED). This project will focus on the environment, lighting, and Irrigation systems. We are also capturing the Images of the plants to apply Leaf Instance Segmentation on it. Using AI and computer vision we can obtain quantitative information on plant phenotyping and plant growth development behavior. The indoor vertical farming system sought to reduce water consumption, increase growth output in a shorter range of time, and provide feedback-based automation, allowing the vertical farm to run with minimal user input. Within this project we aim to achieve multiple growth cycles with precise growing conditions via lighting watering and environmental conditions. The system is based around the Raspberry Pi microcomputer and open-source software and components.
